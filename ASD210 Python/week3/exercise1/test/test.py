Do you read me? Do you read me? Do I need to reach through the TV?
Do I need to reach through the ouija? Houston, I may have gone too Houdini
I'm too uneasy, I'm out of phase and I'm orange Tang and I'm powdered eggs
And my radio has been down for days, I just stand around and sound out the phrase
It go, "Do you read me?" Shook up shoe to beanie, y'all look for the moon graffiti
